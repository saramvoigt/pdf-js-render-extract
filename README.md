#PDF.js Render and Text Extractor

This project demonstrates how to use the [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) library to render PDF files in a browser and programmatically extract text content from them. It uses HTML5 `<canvas>` for rendering and JavaScript to process and display text.

# Features

- Render PDF files in the browser using HTML5 canvas.
- Extract and display text content from the PDF.
- Easy-to-use structure for expanding features like multi-page rendering or file uploads.
